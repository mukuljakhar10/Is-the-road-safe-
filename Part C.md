# Reasons for choosing the particular algorithm in PartA
In Part A, I used Decision Tree classification algorithm to create the model for the dataset given in Part B.<br/>

Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems.
It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.
In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node.
Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. <br/>

It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions.
A decision tree simply asks a question, and based on the answer (Yes/No), it further split the tree into subtrees.
Decision Trees usually mimic human thinking ability while making a decision, so it is easy to understand.
The logic behind the decision tree can be easily understood because it shows a tree-like structure.<br/>


There are various algorithms in Machine learning, so choosing the best algorithm for the given dataset and problem is the main point to remember while creating a machine learning model.
By observing the dataset manually, I noticed that there were groups of people in a particular range of age and gender that had similar interests in movies. 
This observation convinced me to use the Decision Tree Classification Algorithm. Dataset was divided into training set and test set in 80:20 ratio.
After making the model using this algorithm and fitting it with the training data, it was showing 80% accuracy on the test data which is a really good accuracy. 
The results showed that this algorithm is best suited for creating the model on this dataset.<br/>
